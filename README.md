The Spaceship Titanic challenge on Kaggle tasks participants with predicting whether a passenger was transported to another dimension. The dataset includes train.csv containing 8693 records with 14 features including the target variable, test.csv with 4277 records and 13 features, and sample_submission.csv for formatting the output (Kaggle, 2025). 
Dataset provided by Kaggle with passenger demographics, travel, and spending details.
Applied exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training using Random Forest.
Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
The primary goal is to build a classification model that accurately predicts the Transported column, a boolean variable indicating if a passenger experienced dimensional transport.
Tools used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Google Colab, GitHub, Kaggle.
